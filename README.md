# React with backend example

Built on CRA with express backend the purpose of this is to have a simple scaffold to test true client/server JavaScript code in one repo. Unlike Next.js, this is not meant as a serverless application, but instead something to install locally, play around with and have a real client/server interaction. 

Goals:
Custom script to start both client/server
Use sqlite an automatically spin up the database
Alternately, file system save platform agnostic
